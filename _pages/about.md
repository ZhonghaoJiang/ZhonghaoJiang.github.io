I'm a zeroth year Ph.D student from College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. My research interest mainly lies on Intelligent Software Engineering (AI4SE), Large Language Models for Code and SE for AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by **_Distinguished Research Fellow_** _Zhongxin Liu_ of ZJU-CATG Lab from College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. I was advised by **_Prof._** _Meng Yan_ from School of Big Data and Software Engineering, Chongqing University, during my undergraduate studies.
